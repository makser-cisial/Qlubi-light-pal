# Qlubi Face & Body Assembly Guide

Qlubi is composed of two primary printed structures: the **Face module** and the **Body enclosure**.

Each module has its own folder and printing instructions.  
You must complete the instructions within those folders before proceeding to final assembly described here.

This guide explains how both modules integrate into the complete Qlubi device.

---

## Overview of Composition

Qlubi consists of:

- Face Print  
- Body Enclosure (Base + Upper Shell)  
- Lolin S2 Mini  
- LEDs  
- Optional Hats  
- Boots  

No adhesive is required for standard assembly. All components are designed as friction-fit or mechanical lock-fit.

---

# Step 1 — Complete Folder Instructions

Before continuing:

1. Follow all printing instructions inside the **Face folder**.
2. Follow all printing instructions inside the **Body folder**.
3. Ensure all supports are removed cleanly.
4. Confirm scaling has not been altered in your slicer.

Only proceed once both printed assemblies are ready.

# Step 2 — Installing the Face into the Body

The Face is designed to slide vertically into the front cavity of the Body enclosure.

## Installation Process

1. Hold the Body upright.
2. Align the Face print with the internal guide rails.
3. Slide the Face downward slowly.
4. Continue sliding until it reaches the bottom.

At the base of the Body there is a **raised locking feature**.  
The Face contains a matching recess.

Push firmly until the Face locks into place against the raised internal stop.

The Face should:

- Sit flush  
- Not wobble  
- Not lift upward without deliberate force  

If resistance occurs:

- Check for leftover support material  
- Check for minor print stringing along rail edges  

Do not force excessively.

# Step 3 — Assembling the Lolin S2 Mini

Assemble your **Lolin S2 Mini** by 
1. soldering on the pin connectors
2. cutting off the excess from the button to ensure the board lies as flush as possible
3. place on the button in the correct orientation and then the LED wires accordingly going red, black green from the bottom right up

Ensure:

- Pins are correctly soldered  
- LEDs are properly connected  
- No exposed contacts are shorting  

Test functionality before enclosure installation if possible.

---

# Step 4 — Installing the Board into the Base

1. Insert the Lolin S2 Mini into the base cavity.
2. Orient it so the **USB-C port faces the rear opening**.
3. Seat the board flat against the internal platform.

The USB-C port must remain accessible from the back of Qlubi for charging and programming.

Do not trap wires beneath the board.

---

# Step 5 — Installing the LEDs

1. Attach the LEDs to their designated mounting points.
2. Feed LED wiring through the bottom routing holes.
3. Route wires cleanly toward the base.

**Important:**

- Stick the LEDs to the **back interior wall** of the Body.  
- Ensure LEDs face forward toward the Face diffuser area.  
- Confirm no wires obstruct the LED light output.  
- Avoid crossing wires over the LED surface.  

Clean cable routing improves light diffusion and prevents shadowing.

---

# Step 6 — Closing the Body

Once:

- Face is locked in place  
- Board is seated  
- LEDs are positioned  
- Wiring is routed cleanly  

Place the **top shell** onto the Body.

Press down evenly until it seats fully.

---

# Step 7 — Accessories

## Hats

Insert any compatible hat into the top head slot.  
Hats are swappable and require no adhesive.

## Boots

Place boots into their corresponding lower body positions.  
They are designed as friction-fit components.

---

# Adhesives

No glue is required.

However, if your printer tolerances are loose, you may optionally use:

- Small pieces of double-sided tape  
- Minimal removable adhesive  

Avoid permanent glue unless modification is intentional.

---

# Final Check

Before powering on:

- Confirm USB-C port alignment  
- Confirm no wires are pinched  
- Confirm LEDs are unobstructed  
- Confirm Face is fully seated  

Qlubi should now be fully assembled and ready for operation.

---

# Troubleshooting

If components do not fit:

- Recheck scaling in slicer  
- Confirm correct STL files were used  
- Inspect for print warping  
- Remove residual supports fully  

---

Qlubi is modular by design.  
Face styles, hats, and colours can be interchanged without reprinting the full enclosure.
